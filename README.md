The application provides three distinct ways to group the data and two sorting options for a customized viewing experience. The user's view state is saved in the local storage, ensuring persistence even after a page reload.

## Features

### Grouping Options

2. **By User**: Arrange tickets according to the assigned user.
3. **By Priority**: Group tickets based on their priority level.

### Sorting Options

1. **Priority**: Arrange tickets in descending order of priority.
2. **Title**: Sort tickets in ascending order based on their title.

## Usage

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
